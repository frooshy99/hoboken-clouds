# log

A personal finance tool for Python. This program enables you to write down
your daily spending in a time-efficient and simple manner. 
Data is written into and read from an .xlsx file - 
the program will present the stored information in a clean, readable format.
A monthly spending "progress" bar also helps you keep track of your budget for the month.

Planned future updates may add a feature for scheduled inputs for recurring expenses,
such as rent or monthly subscriptions.
